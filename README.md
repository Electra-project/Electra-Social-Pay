General Commands To Use:

!!! NEWEST UPDATE !!!

Telegram:

-Message The Bot To Set Address:
    - !address YourECAaddress

- In Group Say This To Pay:
    - !pay @username amount
        -console will show errors

        * USERS MUST MESSAGE BOT FIRST TO RECEIVE MESSAGES FROM BOT
        Telegram is tricky set up. Users MUST has username set, then their username is saved with their userID. You can then @username and you will be able to interact with user. To avoid spam the app is set up to Message Users directly instead of in chat/group.

        * TypeError Found.. Does Not Stop Application but will show in console. Will fix soon


Twitter:
* Tweet The Following To Set Address:
    * !address @yourBotName YourECAaddress

* Tweet The Following to Pay
    * !pay @theirScreenName Amount

    * There are a few bugs with twitter such as socket time outs if you connect multiple times too quickly. Will need further improvements, but currently works.

Discord:
* Direct Message This to Set Address:
    * !address YourECAaddress

* Message The Following In Your mainChannel to Pay:
    * !pay @theirName Amount

        *There is one bug I've found with getting the userID from their Screen name... Needs further investigation

Slack:
* Message in chat or directly to Set Address:
    * !address YourECAaddress

* To Pay:
    * !pay @username amount
        * No known bugs at this time.
